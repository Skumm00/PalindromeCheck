In this new python project, it is a palindrome checker! With a game and everything in it but I'm not fully sure if all features work as if. To use the repo,download it and open it in VS Code, and then run the code to see the output. I used import random as a library for this 

You can also check the release and download it from there as a zip file, and then extract it
